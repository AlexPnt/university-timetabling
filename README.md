Notes on Automated University Timetabling
===================================

#### Abstract: ####

Timetabling is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem mainly because there are a lot of constraints to be satisfied and a huge search space to be explored. Since the past fifty years, this problem has been studied and a lot of different techniques, with varied success appeared to tackle the problem. In this work an architecture of an engine capable of generating timetables is described. It also shown an example of a possible approach that could be followed. This example is based on a two-stage algorithm where a feasible timetable is first achieved through a simple constructive heuristic and is followed by an iterated local search algorithm with neighbourhood structures able to generate similar solutions and solutions with major differences in order to search different regions of the search space.
